This directory contains the specification of the code generator in
the file specification.pdf.

The specification is complete in the sense that it fully supports
a subset of the B implementation language.

The specification is partial in the sense that some constructs of
the B implementation language are not yet supported. 

The specification will be updated with rules corresponding to the
missing constructs.
